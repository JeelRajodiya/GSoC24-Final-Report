## My Contributions

I created the project from ground up. It involved

-   Defining a fixed file structure to store the content in `mdx` and _typescript_ files.
-   Learning JSON Schema and writing the content for each lesson in the tour. (Technical Writing)
-   Designing the user interface in Figma - [Design File](https://www.figma.com/design/w8ow79jE7lJucJt2zZTbcz/Tour-of-JSON-Schema?node-id=2303-39&t=kFk9dRX3IEzGvgFk-1)
-   Implementing the user interface using react and Chakra Ui
-   Indexing the project on Google search - View the indexed pages [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atour.json-schema.org)
-   Implementing Google analytics

## The current state

The project is ready for production and deployed. It has started to get organic traffic from Google search and JSON Schema official website.

## What's left to do

Some minor changes in the content and UI are still required. And there are some issues with SEO that need to be fixed.
I am planning to maintain the project in the future.

## Challenges while working on the project

Since I had little experience with technical writing, The biggest challenge for me was writing the content for the tour. I had to learn JSON Schema from scratch and write content that is easy to understand for beginners. Along with that, I had to ensure that the content gets **rendered using MDX on the server-side** so we can have better SEO.
